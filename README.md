# Data Modeling in Apache Cassandra for Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree

## Project overview
This is data modeling with **Apache Cassandra** project for Udacity Data Engineer Nanodegree. In this project I create a database schema in **Apache Cassandra** database and **ETL** pipeline that would load CSV files into the database using **Python** and **SQL** in order to facilitate the analysis of this data. This CSV files represent a user activity logs collected by a music streaming app of an imaginary startup Sparkify.

## Prerequisites
The code is **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook** and it uses:

* [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/)
* [Psycopg](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

## Run the Code

`jupyter notebook etl.ipynb`
