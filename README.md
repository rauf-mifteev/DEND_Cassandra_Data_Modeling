# Data Modeling in Apache Cassandra using SQL and Python

## Project overview
This is data modeling with **Apache Cassandra** project for Udacity Data Engineer Nanodegree. In this project I create a database schema in **Apache Cassandra** database and **ETL** pipeline that would load CSV files into the database using **Python** and **SQL** in order to facilitate the analysis of this data. This CSV files represent a user activity logs collected by a music streaming app of an imaginary startup Sparkify.
